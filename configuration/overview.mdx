The Configuration section serves as a guide to start using SOLO. It covers account creation, configuration steps, integration with your system through our SDK, and more.

## Creating a SOLO account

To start with SOLO, you need to visit <a href="https://www.solo.one/" target="_blank">solo.one</a> and book a demo with us. We will present our solution and create your own account.

## Next steps

After having your account, you can access the Platform Admin portal, where you can configure your account and set products and options available for your clients. 

To complete the product configuration and set up the SDK to integrate SOLO into your business page, you will need to cover the four main sections available at the Platform Admin:

- [SDK Configuration](doc:sdk-configuration)
- [Companies](doc:companies)
- [Data Setup](doc:data-setup)
- [Configurations](doc:configurations-settings)

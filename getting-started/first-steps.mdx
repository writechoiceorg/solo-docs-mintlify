SOLO's infrastructure consists of back-end and front-end components, which can be integrated into your platform's workflow. SOLO's integration streamlines everything from data collection to building verified and standardized SMB financial records.

## Embedded Front-end

SOLO SDK is effortlessly embedded into your platform. After the integration, you have access to four main components that address different processes related to statement acquiring:

- **[SMB Onboarding & Accounts Management](doc:connection)**: An easy-to-use interface for small and medium-sized businesses to manage their connected accounts.
- **[Timeline](doc:timeline)**: Our transactions page includes features such as income categorization, direct cost labeling, and compliance with CPA requests.
- **[Financials](doc:financials)**: Our platform provides verified and standardized Profit and Loss (P&L), balance sheet, and cash flow statements. These statements are based on specific ledger configurations and offer dynamic breakdowns and transparent calculations. Every P&L number can be traced back to its source transaction or file, ensuring accuracy and reliability.
- **[Directory](doc:directory)**: A centralized repository is a single location that stores verified customer and vendor accounts, payment history, and subscription information. This information is reliable and can be accessed easily and quickly.

This multifaceted data is crucial in providing deeper insights into the SMB business's financial and commercial aspects.

## Benefits

The SOLO experience is designed to benefit you in several ways:

## SOLO Operation Core Concepts

The SOLO operation involves three players:

- Your Business wants to acquire reliable financial data from different SMB operations to decide which financial products to offer to each one.
- The SMB seeks a financial product, like a loan, but it must provide reliable accounting data to receive a better offer.
- Integrations include banks, ecommerces, and accounts with reliable SMB operational data.

SOLO's solution connects all players, providing a straightforward way for you and SMBs to achieve their objectives.

## The SOLO Method

SOLO's unique method fetches data from each company's key data sources (integrations). The data provided by these integrations will influence four critical areas within SOLO:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Directory">
    SOLO manages customer details by adding new customers, updating existing information, and associating sales with specific customers.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Transactions">
    SOLO matches payouts with bank transactions. Doing so adds useful information such as customers, products, and prices to bank transaction data. With this enriched data, users can easily examine transaction details, including orders, sales, type, and more, by drilling down into specific areas.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Products">
    SOLO manages the business's product information by adding new product details and updating existing ones.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Financials">
    SOLO is a platform that takes raw transaction data from bank, payment, and commerce integrations and uses it to create verified, standardized, and real-time financial statements. An accountant reviews these statements to ensure accuracy so you can be confident in the information they provide.
  </Step>
</Steps> 

By using SOLO, you can speed up your deal velocity by up to ten times. Additionally, you can easily analyze your financial data by drilling down by orders, sales, type, and more.

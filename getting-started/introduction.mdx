SOLO provides banks and fintech companies with access to reliable financial information to qualify Small and Medium-sized Businesses (SMBs) for financial products. SOLO achieves this by offering a comprehensive infrastructure that includes back-end API and front-end SDK components. These components are designed to integrate seamlessly into existing workflows, improving onboarding and screening procedures. SOLO enables stakeholders to establish trust and transparency in their dealings with SMBs.

## The Old Approach

Conventional platforms for qualifying SMBs for financial products use outdated approaches that are slow, incomplete, or do not provide standardized information regarding accounting, commerce, and banking data. Through these platforms, SMBs self-report data by uploading financial statements and filling forms or through accounting tools like QuickBooks, Zero, and Netsuite.

### Problems with Self-Reported Data

The conventional solutions provide only self-reported data and some raw data for cross-referencing. The lack of standardization makes cross-referencing quite challenging, leading companies to either accept self-reported data as it is or put a significant effort into rebuilding it. If you are in this situation, you probably are dealing with the following issues: 

- **Lack of Verification**: Self-reported data is often unreliable as it lacks proper verification. This lack of verification can lead to longer transaction closing times and require external diligence. Furthermore, it can also lower the transaction volume on the platform. To gain more business, trust is crucial.
- **Lack of Standardization**: Comparing profit and loss statements (P&L) from different SMBs becomes challenging as they may calculate specific numbers differently, leading to compromised transparency.
- **Limited Financial Update Frequency**: Many small businesses only update financial records annually through a tax accountant, which creates friction for founders when adopting new platforms due to outdated financial information.
